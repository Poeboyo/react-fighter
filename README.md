# Fiercest Fighters React Build

Currently in Production

## How it's made

- The application starts out on the home page which on click will bring you to the character selection screen, where (obviously) you select a Character to fight for you and a second player.

* Also shown in the function above, battle animations will be displayed on hit and will use Audio samples to indicate a hit or a miss

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Giphy Stickers
- Audio Samples
- Materialize CSS

## Difficulties and Learning

- Another addition to this version of the game is currently in the stages of allowing for scalability to mobile devices but Chrome and Safari are being probelmatic on Mobile Devices.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Making the Application, Mobile Friendly (Scaling characters for mobile is tedious)
- [ ] Allowing Remote Play Via Bitly or a similar service
- [ ] Implementing a Remote Controller Package such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/gamecontroller.js
- [ ] Integrating a backend, allowing users create and share their characters and battle with others.
